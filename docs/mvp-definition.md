# MVP Definition 

**MVP**: A full-stack portfolio application that showcases exxternal project demos via a Java-based reverse proxy, logging visitors engagement to a PostgreSQL database.

## In Scope (what I need to build)
* **React-UI** A basic layout with experience (about me), and Project portfolio sections.
* **Java Proxy** A backend server that can fetch and display at least one project.
* **Data Logging** Recording project Ids and timestamps in PostgreSQL when a demo is launched.
* **Deployment** The web-app must be hosted (e.g. on firebase, github-pages, render, etc.).

## Out-of-Scope (Items I want to add for enhancing the project)
* User Accounts/login for visitors 
* An admin dasboard for viewing analystics (I will be checking the DB manually for now).
